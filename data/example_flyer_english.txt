With this law, the government declares "The Moor has done his duty, he should go"
All you comrades who have been in the field, couldn't you also have been crippled?
You women who have your husband back, help us in this fight, think humanely.
Without your solidarity we must perish.
On the one hand, the state spends millions unnecessarily and on the other hand, the unnecessary should be saved on the war victims and survivors.
Your support should consist of demonstrating together with us.
Friedrich Ebert is of the same opinion.
We demonstrate for law, justice and humane existence.
High solidarity! High the camaraderie!
Remember the victims of war!
Do not forget the widows and wise men!
Our motto is: One for all, all for one!

Reich Association of War Victims, War Participants and War Survivors.
Local group Stuttgart and Canstatt.

The place and time of the demonstration will be announced in the newspapers and posters.
